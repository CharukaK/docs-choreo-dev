# Configure Subscription Approval

Choreo allows you to create subscription plans that require approval before being activated. This feature enables you to control access to APIs by requiring administrative review and authorization of subscriptions before they become active.

## Overview

The permission involved with managing subscription approval is:

- **Approve API subscriptions**: A user with this permission can approve or reject subscription requests.

## Steps:

1. [Create an API subscription plan](../../administer/create-api-subscription-plans.md) that requires approval
2. [Assign a subscription plan](assign-subscription-plans-to-apis.md) that requires approval to an API
3. [Subscribe to an API](subscribe-to-an-api-with-a-subscription-plan.md) using a plan that requires approval
4. [Configure the approvers](../../administer/configure-approvals-for-choreo-workflows.md) for your organization
5. [Review and approve the request](../../administer/review-workflow-approval-requests.md)
