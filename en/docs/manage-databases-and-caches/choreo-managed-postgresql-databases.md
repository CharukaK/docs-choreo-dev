3. Click **Create** and select **PostgreSQL** as the database type. Provide a display name for this server and follow the instructions.
4. Select your preferred cloud provider from AWS, Azure, GCP, or Digital Ocean.

    - There is no functional difference between databases created on different cloud providers, apart from changes to service plans (and associated costs). 
5. Choose the region for your database.
   - Available regions will depend on the selected cloud provider. Choreo currently supports US and EU regions across all providers.
6. Select the service plan.
   - Service plans vary in the dedicated CPU, memory (RAM), storage space allocated for your database, the backup retention periods, and high-availability configurations for production use-cases.
