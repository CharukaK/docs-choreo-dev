# Choreo Platform Services Billing

The platform services you create within your Choreo Organization, such as databases, caches, or Kafka services will be included in your current Choreo subscription. The pricing depends on the usage and service plan of the resources you create.

Key billing considerations:

- Usage is billed hourly. For example, if you create a database, cache, or Kafka service that you later remove within the same month, you will only be billed for the number of hours it was active.
- Fixed pricing based on service plan. Choreo does not include additional charges for network bandwidth usage.

!!!Tip "Try out the free trial"
    Choreo provides a 7 day free trial for all database types on the 'Hobbyist' service plan (for free tier users).
