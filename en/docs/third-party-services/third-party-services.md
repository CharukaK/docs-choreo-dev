# Third Party Services

Choreo allows you to connect to external services, such as APIs, applications, and other resources, to integrate them with your applications. This enables you to leverage the functionality and data of these external systems within your Service.

In order to connect to a third-party service, you need to register it with Choreo. The registered services will be discoverable via the Internal Marketplace, which will allow you to search, browse, and select the services you want to integrate with your services.

The required third party service can be consumed via a Connection.
