The Choreo suite comprises 5 profiles that work together seamlessly:
  
 - **Internal Developer Platform** is a full lifecycle cloud native application development platform to create, deploy, run, and govern APIs, integrations, and microservices on Kubernetes. Gives you the benefit of organization-wide productivity via self-service teams, governance and security, enterprise marketplaces, and business metrics.

 - **iPaaS** is a developer-friendly, serverless platform for writing real integrations as code or low-code. You can create scheduled tasks, reusable APIs, or event-driven integrations, and build, deploy, run, and observe in a seamless serverless, multi-cloud, and multi-environment setup.

 - **Cloud Native App Developer** provides you with the flexibility to design, develop, deploy, and operate your backend APIs, services, integrations, and more with any programming language of your choice.

 - **DevOps** allows you to release and manage applications on Kubernetes without compromising on security, reliability, or governance, across any cloud.
