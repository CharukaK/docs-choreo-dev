# Third Party Service

Third-party services are external applications, platforms, or APIs that integrate with your primary system to enhance its functionality, extend its capabilities, or provide specialized features. These services are developed and maintained by separate entities, offering expertise in specific domains that may not be core to your main application.


# Third Party Service Endpoint
A service endpoint is a set of parameters that are required to establish a connection to a third-party service. These parameters may include the URL, authentication credentials, and other configurations required to access the service.
