# Service Users and Access Control List

Choreo for Apache Kafka uses access control lists (ACL) and user definitions to establish individual rights to produce, consume or manage topics. To manage users and ACL entries, you can access the corresponding tabs on the service page within the Choreo Console.

In the **Users** tab, you can add users to the Kafka service by providing a username. By default, new users have no permissions. To grant access, set permissions through the **Access Control List (ACL)**.

An ACL entry defines the following:

- Username
- Permission (e.g., read, write)
- Associated topic

To configure access, navigate to the **ACL** tab and add an entry specifying the user, permission, and relevant topic.
